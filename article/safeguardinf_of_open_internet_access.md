# Net neutrality: BEREC article 3: Safeguarding of Open Internet Access

Article 3(1) sets out the rights of end-users of IAS;

Article 3(2) sets limits on the contractual conditions which may be applied to IAS
and the commercial practices of ISPs providing IAS, and requires that these should
not limit exercise of the end-user rights set out in paragraph 1. When assessing
commercial practices, Article 3(3) should also be taken into account;

Article 3(3) constrains ISPs’ traffic management practices, setting a requirement
that ISPs should treat all data traffic equally and making provision for the specific circumstances under which ISPs may deviate from this rule;

Article 3(4) sets out the conditions under which traffic management measures may
entail processing of personal data;

Article 3(5) sets out the freedom of ISPs and CAPs to provide specialised services
as well as the conditions under which this freedom may be exercised.

--------------------------
IAS - “internet access service” (IAS) as an ECS that provides access to the internet, and thereby connectivity to virtually all end points of the internet, irrespective of the network technology and terminal equipment used.

CAP - "Content and Application Provider" (CAPs make content (e.g. web pages, blogs, video) and/or applications (e.g. search engines, VoIP applications) and/or services available on the Internet. CAPs may also make content, services and applications available via specialised services.

ECS - The term “provider of electronic communications to the public” (PECP) comprises bott “public communications networks” and “electronic communications services” (ECS), which are defined in Article 2 of the Framework Directive.

# Article 3(3) first subparagraph
Providers of internet access services shall treat all traffic equally, when providing internet access services, without discrimination, restriction or interference, and irrespective of the sender and receiver, the content accessed or distributed, the applications or services used or provided, or the terminal
equipment used.

* NRAs should take into account that equal treatment does not necessarily imply that all end-users will experience the same network performance or quality of service (QoS). Thus, even though packets can experience varying transmission performance (e.g. on parameters such as latency or jitter), packets can normally be considered to be treated equally as long as all packets are processed agnostic to sender and receiver, to the content accessed or distributed, and to the application or service used or provided.

* Endpoint-based congestion control (a typical example is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control) does not contravene Article 3(3) first subparagraph since, by definition, it takes place within terminal equipment and terminal equipment is not covered by the Regulation

* Examples involving technical discrimination:

- A practice where an ISP blocks, slows down, restricts, interferes with, degrades or discriminates access to specific content, one or more applications (or categories thereof), except when justified by reference to the exceptions of Article 3(3) third subparagraph.
- IAS offers where access to the internet is restricted to a limited set of applications or endpoints by the end-user’s ISP (sub-internet service offers) infringe upon Article 3(3) first subparagraph, as such offers entail blocking of applications and / or discrimination, restriction or interference related to the origin or destination of the information.
- A zero-rating offer where all applications are blocked (or slowed down) once the
data cap is reached except for the zero-rated application(s), as it would infringe
Article 3(3) first (and third) subparagraph.

# Article 3(3) second subparagraph
The first subparagraph shall not prevent providers of internet access services from implementing reasonable traffic management measures. In order to be deemed to be reasonable, such measures shall be transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate, and shall not be based on commercial considerations but on objectively different technical quality of service requirements of specific
categories of traffic. Such measures shall not monitor the specific content and shall not be maintained for longer than necessary.

* When considering whether a traffic management measure is non-discriminatory, NRAs should consider the following:
- The requirement for traffic management measures to be non-discriminatory does
not preclude ISPs from implementing - in order to optimise the overall transmission quality and user experience - traffic management measures which differentiate between objectively different categories of traffic (ref. Recital 9 and paragraphs 59-64 below).
- Similar situations in terms of similar technical QoS requirements should receive
similar treatment.
- Different situations in terms of objectively different technical QoS requirements can be treated in different ways if such treatment is objectively justified.
- In particular, the mere fact that network traffic is encrypted should not be deemed by NRAs to be an objective justification for different treatment by ISPs.

* Examples for technical QoS requirements are latency, jitter, packet loss, and bandwidth.

# Article 3(3) third subparagraph
Providers of internet access services shall not engage in traffic management measures going beyond those set out in the second subparagraph, and in particular shall not block, slow down, alter, restrict, interfere with, degrade or discriminate between specific content, applications or services, or specific
categories thereof, except as necessary, and only for as long as necessary, in order to:

* Article 3(3), third subparagraph contains two aspects:
- a prohibition for ISPs to apply traffic management measures going beyond
reasonable traffic management measures; as well as
- an exhaustive list of three exceptions in which traffic management measures that
go beyond such reasonable traffic management are permissible.

# Article 3(3) letter (a)
(a) comply with Union legislative acts, or national legislation that complies with Union law, to which the provider of internet access services is subject, or with measures that comply with Union law giving effect to such Union legislative acts or national legislation, including with orders by courts or public
authorities vested with relevant powers;

# Article 3(3) letter (b)
(b) preserve the integrity and security of the network, of services provided via that network, and of the terminal equipment of end-users;

# Article 3(3) letter (c)
(c) prevent impending network congestion and mitigate the effects of exceptional or temporary network congestion, provided that equivalent categories of traffic are treated equally.
